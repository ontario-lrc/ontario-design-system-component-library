# ontario-critical-alert

Use a critical alert banner to bring a userâ€™s attention to a significant situation, such as a site-wide service disruption or other critical information that will impact most users.

## Usage guidance

Please refer to the [Ontario Design System](https://designsystem.ontario.ca/components/detail/critical-alerts.html) for current documentation guidance.

## Configuration

Once the component package has been installed (see Ontario Design System Component Library for installation instructions), the input component can be added directly into the project's code, and can be customized by updating the properties outlined [here](#properties). Please see the [examples](#examples) below for how to configure the component.

## Examples

One way to use the critical alert component is by explicitly passing in the content through the `content` property - this will override any HTML content passed as a child of the critical alert component (see the next example), and the resulting content text passed into the `content` property will be displayed.

```html
<ontario-critical-alert content="This is the content for the critical alert" />
```

Alternatively, HTML content can be supplied as the child of the critical alert rather than through the `content` property. Note that no paragraph tag is passed as the first child of the HTML content, as it is already included in the components render method.

```html
<ontario-critical-alert>
	<a href="https://designsystem.ontario.ca/">Ontario Design System</a> web components now available!!!
</ontario-critical-alert>
```
